* Your Puppet manifests first line must be a comment explaining what the Puppet manifest is about
* Your Puppet manifests files must end with the extension .pp

## Note on Versioning

Your Ubuntu 14.04 VM should have Puppet 3.4 preinstalled.

You do not need to attempt to upgrade versions. This project is simply a set of tasks to familiarize you with the basic level syntax which is virtually identical in newer versions of Puppet.

The linked documentation is to Puppet 3.8 because the 3.4 documentation has been archived and is therefore more challenging to navigate. If you would like to upgrade anyway, click here (this will not affect how your code is checked). Puppet 5 Docs
